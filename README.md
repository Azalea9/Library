## 1. Introduction
As part of my learning on the QA Software developer	bootcamp, I am creating a digital library app to demonstrate the skills I have acquired on the bootcamp. This is to showcase the techniques, tools, and languages I have learned as a Software developer during my bootcamp.

## 2. Digital Library app 
The Digital Library app has the following functions:
 - Allow a book to be added to the Library
 - Allow a book's ISBN, title and author to be updated
 - Allow a book to be removed from the Library
 - Allow a User to create a Library subscription
 - Allow a User to update their email address on their account
 - Allow a User to loan a book from the Library
 - Allow a User to return a book to the Library
 - Prevent a User from borrowing more than 5 books at one time
 
 
The final product will be a n-tiered architecture (MVC) of an Web based backend application with RESTful APIs
 - Model
 - Controller
 - View
